# Pictour - Image Browsing App
Pictour is a react native app which lets you browse images using different keywords. 
The project was developed using the [Expo](https://expo.io/) framework and all the image data are fetched from the [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) api.

## Installation
- Install expo-cli globally
```
yarn add --global expo-cli
```
- Navigate to the project directory and install the node modules with the following command using yarn or npm
```
cd pic-app
yarn install
```
- Start the development server
```
expo start
```
> This will start the Metro Bundler, which is an HTTP server that compiles the JavaScript code of the app using Babel and serves it to the Expo app.
